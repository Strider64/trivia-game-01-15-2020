I am in the process of writing a tutorial on this vanilla jascript game at https://www.miniaturephotographer.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=9 

It's a work-in-progress as I am doing a little bit each day, so keep checking back and the tutorial will eventually be finished.

Improved gameplay, added scoring, checking for end-of-game and made the game responsive for the iPhone and other smartphone devices. I also added a Photography category as my website is a photograpy website. I am in the process of adding a maintence page that I can enter new questions and ansers along with editing them as well.

Trivia Game written in Javascript, Ajax, JSON and PHP using Smarty Template System. After taking about a 3 year hiatus from programming the coding bug has bitten me.

I have revised the trivia game even more! The game is written with the latest javascript (JS6) for the most part and right now it might not work in older browsers and you can pretty much forget Internet Explorer.  I still have a lot of updating to this game and I will be creating branches in order for more stable versions to be available. 

# History of this Trivia Game
The very first version of this Trivia Game was done in Adobe Flash and it even had sound effects, plus some cheezy graphics. I think I even made it a Hangman Version out of the Trivia Game. Anyways, I decided to rewrite the game, but this time using jQuery which was another big mistake. I personally don't like the extra library that you have to have in order for the game to run. So, once again I decided to rewrite this game in Vanilla JavaScript in order to be better portable in order to run without a library. Vanilla JavaScript really isn't that much harder and you can actually write Js code that is about JQuery size and even smaller as you don't need a library. I have also manage to learn PHP and I actually have become good in writing PHP code. I would consider myself an immediate to advance PHP programmer

# Plans for the Trivia Game
I want to finish up the scoring and playability of the game then add where users can add their own questions/answers to the database table.
