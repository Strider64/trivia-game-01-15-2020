Trivia Game written in Javascript, Ajax, JSON and PHP using Smarty Template System. After taking about a 3 year hiatus from programming the coding bug has bitten me. 

# History of this Trivia Game
The very first version of this Trivia Game was done in Adobe Flash and it even had sound effects, plus some cheezy graphics. I think I even made it a Hangman Version out of the Trivia Game. Anyways, I decided to rewrite the game, but this time using jQuery which was another big mistake. I personally don't like the extra library that you have to have in order for the game to run. So, once again I decided to rewrite this game in Vanilla JavaScript in order to be better portable in order to run with a library. Vanilla JavaScript really isn't that much harder and you can actually write it code that is about JQuery size and even smaller as you don't need a library. I have also manage to learn PHP and I actually have become good in writing PHP code. I would consider myself an immediate to advance PHP person.

# Plans for the Trivia Game
I want to finish up the scoring and playability of the game then add where users can add their own questions/answers to the database table.
